#Enrollment Data

```{r}

```
1. There are 19,126,783 observations in the dataset. 
2. There are 26 different plans in the dataset.
3. I was unable to display the table as the code wouldn't run

```{r}
ggplot(data = final.data, aes(x=year, y=avg_enrollment)) +
  geom_line() + ggtitle("Average Enrollees in Medicare Advantage") +
  labs(x="Year", y="Average Enrollment")
```
